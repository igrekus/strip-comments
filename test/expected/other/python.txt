Python
Inline comments in Python use the hash ('#') character, as in the two examples in this code:


print("Hello World!")  
Block comments, as defined in this article, don't technically exist in Python.[49] A bare string literal represented by a triple-quoted string can be used[50] but is not ignored by the interpreter in the same way that "#" comment is. In the examples below, the triple double-quoted strings act in this way as comments, but are also treated as docstrings:



class MyClass(object):
    

    def my_method(self):
        

def my_function():
