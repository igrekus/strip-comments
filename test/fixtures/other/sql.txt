SQL
Comments in SQL are in single-line-only form, when using two dashes:

-- This is a single line comment
-- followed by a second line
SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM Authors
       WHERE Authors.name = 'Smith'; -- Note: we only want 'smith'
                                     -- this comment appears after SQL code
